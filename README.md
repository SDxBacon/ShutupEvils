# Shut up evils! 閉嘴! 你這邪惡的東西
<img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/69HqKlT.png" >

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在公家機關服兵役的期間，有一位同事不斷在辦公時間打電動、使用Raidcall語音與人聊天。最誇張的是，他玩遊戲玩到生氣時，他會用力敲打桌面、拍打鍵盤、大聲用麥克風與RC語音中的夥伴幹譙，此舉嚴重影響辦公環境。而他又仗著有親戚是地方議員，沒人奈何的了他。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;因此，此專案主要是在該人員電腦放入一個背景執行程式，透過相同子網域中的UDP封包來控制對方的防火牆規則，進而限制該人員的RC語音網路封包一段時間。未來目標放在完成taskkill功能，將對方遊戲程式也一併強制關閉。
